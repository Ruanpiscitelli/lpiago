Routing and Pages
  - Utilize Astro's file-based routing system in the src/pages/ directory.
  - Implement dynamic routes using [...slug].astro syntax.
  - Use getStaticPaths() for generating static pages with dynamic routes.
  - Implement proper 404 handling with a 404.astro page.

  Content Management
  - Use Markdown (.md) or MDX (.mdx) files for content-heavy pages.
  - Leverage Astro's built-in support for frontmatter in Markdown files.
  - Implement content collections for organized content management.

  Styling
  - Use Astro's scoped styling with <style> tags in .astro files.
  - Leverage global styles when necessary, importing them in layouts.
  - Utilize CSS preprocessing with Sass or Less if required.
  - Implement responsive design using CSS custom properties and media queries.
